### Listening Skill : Recognize Examples
Speakers often include examples to illustrate their ideas.
Listening for examples can help you better understand and remember these ideas. Listen for the following phrases that speakers use to introduce examples:
- for example..., for instances..., such as..., like..., an example of ...
Sometimes spekaers give examples without using an introductory phrase:
" A chapter at the end of the Chang's book gives some data about the responses. Nineteen percent of the responses were about love"
Speakers may also use photos or other visuals to introduce their examples.

### Note-taking skill : use an outline
Using an outline can help you take notes that ar clearly organized.
In English, a good outline starts with an important idea on the left.
Then supporting examples related to the idea are added underneath and indented.

Idea 1
- Example 1
- Example 2
Idea 2
- Example 1
- Example 2

### Speaking skill : Agree and disagree
During a discussion, speakers often use phrases to show they agree or disagree with another speaker.
Use these phrases to agree:

Use these phrases to disagree and to introduce your own opinions:
- I disagree, I don't know, I don't think so, I'm not so sure about that...
